# idKrantt
Intelligent Designs by Krantt. We built it in a better way for you.

## Hello.
Hi! My name is Tobias, I'm from Krantt S.H., we are building this software for those developers whose are badly tired of Bootstrap's alike tools and wants something different in a different way. Meet idKrantt, and say bye for infinite CSS code. UX/UI built by experts, and AI Powered. You will find everything here, and the most important part, it's ready for use and the output is easy to modify.


# The very first thing to do is..
Nowadays we have a lot of designs on the web that can be easily exploded by an AI, mainly on Figma, but there is no code for that designs. Thats why we need to create a plugin that retrieves all the design info (CSS code) from components. By the moment we only have deployed the plugin and made it to return a json object containing all the data of the components. That will be used for code them into real components.

## Why we use components?
Components make everything easy. With them you can create easily an entire web application in few hours. So, just imagine the power of this compiled data of a lot of components and the use of GPT-3 or even GPT-2 to understand the needs of UX/UI design of your application. Just like I said, it's Intelligent design. Even more powerful than one human. And if the machine doesn't work the job of creating the design will be much more flexible and quick.


### It will take a looong time until..
It will take a very long time until it's full ready and in-production, but in the mean-while we are going to publish some tools for you, and your people. We hope to help you ASAP, but you need to wait for us. We are almost there!

## Imprtant.
We know that's not cool for bkend people work with frontend tools, but it's not alike any other. Expect us.

### OK... wait a minute before you go
I'll tell you the reason why we don't have this in the Krantt's github organization. My partners doesn't know anything yet about this project and they do not use github for anything. So I'm all alone on it but..! I hope to have something amazing before x-mas <3
